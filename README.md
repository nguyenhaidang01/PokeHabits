Welcome to **PokeHabits**, a unique ToDo application designed to make tracking your habits more engaging and fun!

## What is PokeHabits?

PokeHabits is a ToDo app that stands out with its distinctive feature: it visualizes your habits as Pokémon! Each habit you track in the app is represented by a Pokémon. As you consistently work on your habits and accumulate experience points (EXP), the Pokémon representing your habit will evolve, reflecting your progress.

## Key Features

- **Pokémon Representation**: Each habit is illustrated by a Pokémon, making habit tracking more interactive and enjoyable.
- **Evolution System**: As you earn EXP by completing tasks related to your habit, your Pokémon will evolve, showcasing your progress in a fun and visual way.

## How It Works

1. **Add a Habit**: Create a new habit and assign a Pokémon to represent it.
2. **Track Your Progress**: Complete tasks to earn EXP for your Pokémon.
3. **Evolve Your Pokémon**: Once your habit reaches a certain amount of EXP, the Pokémon will evolve, reflecting your progress and keeping you motivated.
